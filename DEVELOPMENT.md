# Development

---
- **4/18/20** Made basic draw method for drawing pool table 
    - Need to look into how to use Box2D correctly (how to create world/bodies)
    
- **4/19/20** Implement basic friction and ball bouncing
    - Test inplementations by applying arbitrary force which causes ball to move in order to test boundaries and friction
